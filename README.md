> Bash is a name of the unix shell, which was also distributed as the shell for the GNU operating system and as the default shell on most Linux distros. Nearly all examples below can be a part of a shell script or executed directly in the shell.

```bash
# Simple hello world example:
echo "Hello world!" # => Hello world!

# Built-in variables:
# There are some useful built-in variables, like:
echo "Last program's return value: $?"
echo "Script's PID: $$"
echo "Number of arguments passed to script: $#"
echo "All arguments passed to script: $@"
echo "Script's arguments separated into different variables: $1 $2..."

# Brace Expansion {...}
# used to generate arbitrary strings:
echo {1..10} # => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
echo {a..z} # => a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
# This will output the range from the start value to the end value.
# Note that you can't use variables here:
from=1
to=10
echo {$from..$to} # => {$from..$to}

# Now that we know how to echo and use variables,
# let's learn some of the other basics of Bash!

# Our current directory is available through the command `pwd`.
# `pwd` stands for "print working directory".
# We can also use the built-in variable `$PWD`.
# Observe that the following are equivalent:
echo "I'm in $(pwd)" # execs `pwd` and interpolates output
echo "I'm in $PWD" # interpolates the variable

# If you get too much output in your terminal, or from a script, the command
# `clear` clears your screen:
clear
# Ctrl-L also works for clearing output.

# Reading a value from input:
echo "What's your name?"
read name
# Note that we didn't need to declare a new variable.
echo "Hello, $name!"

# We have the usual if structure.
# Condition is true if the value of $name is not equal to the current user's login username:
if [[ "$name" != "$USER" ]]; then
    echo "Your name isn't your username"
else
    echo "Your name is your username"
fi

# To use && and || with if statements, you need multiple pairs of square brackets:
read age
if [[ "$name" == "Steve" ]] && [[ "$age" -eq 15 ]]; then
    echo "This will run if $name is Steve AND $age is 15."
fi

if [[ "$name" == "Daniya" ]] || [[ "$name" == "Zach" ]]; then
    echo "This will run if $name is Daniya OR Zach."
fi
# There are other comparison operators for numbers listed below:
# -ne - not equal
# -lt - less than
# -gt - greater than
# -le - less than or equal to
# -ge - greater than or equal to

# There is also the `=~` operator, which tests a string against the Regex pattern:
email=me@example.com
if [[ "$email" =~ [a-z]+@[a-z]{2,}\.(com|net|org) ]]
then
    echo "Valid email!"
fi

# There is also conditional execution
echo "Always executed" || echo "Only executed if first command fails"
# => Always executed
echo "Always executed" && echo "Only executed if first command does NOT fail"
# => Always executed
# => Only executed if first command does NOT fail

# A single ampersand & after a command runs it in the background. A background command's
# output is printed to the terminal, but it cannot read from the input.
sleep 30 &
# List background jobs
jobs # => [1]+  Running                 sleep 30 &
# Bring the background job to the foreground
fg
# Ctrl-C to kill the process, or Ctrl-Z to pause it
# Resume a background process after it has been paused with Ctrl-Z
bg
# Kill job number 2
kill %2
# %1, %2, etc. can be used for fg and bg as well
```
